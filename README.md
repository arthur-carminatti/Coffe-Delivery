# Coffe-Delivery

<h2>Project Description</h2>
Welcome to the "Coffee-Delivery" project, Challenge 02 of the 'Ignite' course by Rocketseat. In this project, we are using ReactJS with TypeScript and creating the project using Vite, which allows for quick and efficient setup. Please note that this project is still a work in progress.

The Coffee-Delivery project is an e-commerce platform for a coffee shop. The goal is to provide customers with a seamless experience to select their desired coffee, make a payment, and track their order.
